# Prepare the data

If you wish to contribute to the growth of the database with your experimental data, we will ask you for a set of experimental conditions and results. Among this information, we will ask you for the concentrations of the TEOS reagents, water, ethanol and ammonia you used, the temperature and reaction time, the average diameter of the synthesized particles and their standard deviation, along with information to cite your work. All the variables we will ask you for are described in detail in the metadata of the [database repository](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NR842).
