# Why to contribute with your data
If you have been working synthesizing silica nanoparticles via St√∂ber process, or you have been studying this system, or you wish to do both in a near future, you could put this database to good use, and by doing so, contribute to its growth.
There are many ways to contribute to the project, one is by **adding new data** from your own experiments to the database, another is by **publishing statistical studies and models** that you generate from the database. Both ways help to grow both the database and the community, which in turn helps to create new and more complex models and to better understand the system.

Our long-term vision is that the nanosynthesis research community opens and shares its data as this will advance the nanosynthesis field in a more sustainable way globally.
