# Contributor Guidelines

Welcome to our team and thanks for taking the time to contribute!

We are a team of researchers/students with the goal to create a **public database** on the experimental conditions for the **synthesis of silica nanoparticles**.

Do not forget to read the Code of Conduct. Feel free to propose changes to this document and open an issue if necesary.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Adding instances to the database
If you have been working synthesizing silica nanoparticles via St√∂ber process, you may wish to contribute to Open Science by **adding your experimental conditions and results to the database**. This way, your work and results can be helpful to the growing comunity and contribute to make reproducible synthesis a mainstream fenomena. 

Read the steps to follow in order to join the Open Research Data community and contribute with your data [here][contribute-with-data]. 

### Suggesting improvements and reporting errors

This section guides you through submitting an improvement suggestion for the database, including completely new features and minor improvements.

If you find your work information to be wrongly uploaded, you can also use this guideline to make us aware of the issue, so we can correct it.

### Uploading data analysis

If you have used the database to make data analysis of any kind and would like to upload your results to the comunnity, you can follow this guideline. New created models can help the community to better understand the nanosystem and improve the quality and optimization of new syntheses.

### Thanks for your contributions!
We are really proud to be part of this Open Comunnity and grateful for all of you that help us to enhance it. We believe that Open Science is essential to provide global knowledge and give every enthusiastic scientist the oportunity to generate more and improve the existing technologies. By contributing to it, you are being part of a great revolution in science, and we thank you infinitely.
