# The Project

The Open Stober Project is a scientific community network and data structure, aimed to provide anyone, anywhere, open access to data about Stober silica.

## Why Stober silica?

Silica micro- and nanoparticles are highly useful materials for industrial applications, medicine and science (e.g. electronics, biotechnology, catalysis, water purification, drug and gene delivery, chromatography) because of their specific structural properties (e.g. swelling capacity, strength, durability, thermal stability, dielectric properties). A calibrated, monodisperse size is a requirement for the use of these particles in nano-medicine or for the design of new composite materials. The Stöber synthesis provides such particles, is robust and scalable. Its main difficulty is to reach a size that has not been synthesized before, due to the complexity of the synthesis process. We believe that with an open and global database that compiles a large amount of information on stöber synthesis, this difficulty could be solved by reducing the need for repeating already reported conditions and increasing reproducibility. Also, it is useful for statistical and machine learning models to guide the design and synthesis of calibrated and monodispersed silica NPs.

## Why an open project?

With this open project, we aim at building a community of contributors for adding new synthesis data and using the dataset to make data analysis and create models that can help to better understand the nanosystem.

Our long-term vision is that the nanosynthesis research community opens and shares its data as this will advance the nanosynthesis field in a more sustainable way globally.
