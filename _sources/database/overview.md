# Overview

The Open Stöber Database is an open database about Stöber synthesis of silica nanoparticles works (including particle diameters, their dispersion and the experimental conditions that led to those results).

Our goal is to facilitate the preparation of silica nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the Stober method using Open Data.

This database aims to reduce the need for repeating already reported conditions and increase reproducibility. Also, it is useful for statistical and machine learning models to guide the design and synthesis of calibrated and monodispersed silica NPs.

We aim at building a community of contributors for adding new synthesis data, towards a better understanding of Stöber process.

Our long-term vision is that the nanosynthesis research community opens and shares its data as this will advance the nanosynthesis field in a more sustainable way globally.
